# Inventory Keeper
A program that keeps track of the inventories of multiple stores of a franchise.
The application uses a ThreadedAVL tree to keep track of all items in its inventory and uses a SkipList data structure to manage all the stores of a franchise.
The program supports amortized logarithmic lookup, insertion and deletion of stores. Furthermore, lookup of items in inventory is also logarithmic.
